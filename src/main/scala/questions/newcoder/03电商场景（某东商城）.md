## SQL13 计算商城中2021年每月的GMV
```mysql
-- 方法1
select date_format(event_time, '%Y-%m') month,
       sum(total_amount)                gmv
from tb_order_overall
where date_format(event_time, '%Y') = '2021'
  and status in (0, 1)
group by date_format(event_time, '%Y-%m')
having gmv > 100000
order by gmv;

-- 方法2
select substr(event_time, 1, 7) month,
       sum(total_amount)        gmv
from tb_order_overall
where substr(event_time, 1, 4) = '2021'
  and status in (0, 1)
group by substr(event_time, 1, 7)
having gmv > 100000
order by gmv;

-- 方法3
select date_format(event_time, '%Y-%m') month,
       sum(total_amount)                GMV
from tb_order_overall
where status in (0, 1)
  and year(event_time) = '2021'
group by month
having sum(total_amount) > 100000
order by GMV;

知识点：
1、date_format(date, format)，例如date_format('2022-04-01 10:10:10', '%Y-%m-%d')
2、substr(date, start, end) / substring(date, start, end)，start是从1开始的，范围是[start,end]
3、year(date)提取出年份
```

## SQL14 统计2021年10月每个退货率不大于0.5的商品各项指标
```mysql

       if(payment = 0, 0, round(refund / payment, 3)) as refund_rate
from t
where if(payment = 0, 0, round(refund / payment, 3)) <= 0.5
order by 1;

-- 方法2
select product_id,
       round(sum(if_click) / count(1), 3)         ctr,
       round(sum(if_cart) / sum(if_click), 3)     cart_rate,

  and a.status = 1
group by c.product_id
having round(round(1 - (sum(b.cnt * c.in_price) / sum(b.cnt * b.price)), 3) * 100, 1) > 24.9;

-- 方法2
SELECT product_id, CONCAT(profit_rate, "%") as profit_rate

         HAVING rate > 24.9
             OR product_id is null
         ORDER BY product_id
     ) as t1;
知识点：
1、保留1位小数：ROUND(x, 1)
2、订单明细表内连接商品信息表：tb_order_detail JOIN tb_product_info USING(product_id)
-- JOIN ...USING(字段) 代表内连接
-- using(字段) 代表使用这个字段连接两个表
3、IFNULL(product_id, '店铺汇总')  coalesce()函数
4、with rollup
```
